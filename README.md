This is the project built in the Ionic Definitive Start Guide found on AirPair. You can find the post here: https://www.airpair.com/ionic-framework/posts/the-definitive-ionic-starter-guide.

### Setup

Assuming you have NodeJS installed, setup Ionic and Gulp (for the building of the app) with the following.

    npm install -g ionic gulp

Then clone this repo and start a local preview of the codebase.

    git clone https://github.com/gnomeontherun/ionic-definitive-guide.git
    cd ionic-definitive-guide
    npm install
    ionic serve
